\title{Generate a faceted violin-boxplot of gene expression with highlighted sample and padj labels}
\usage{
plot_gene_expression_multi(ods, genes, sampleID)
}
\arguments{
\item{ods}{An OUTRIDER dataset (SummarizedExperiment object)}

\item{genes}{A character vector of gene symbols or Ensembl IDs to plot}

\item{sampleID}{A character string specifying the sample ID to highlight}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing expression distributions with violin and boxplots, faceted by gene,
        with the specified sample highlighted and labeled by its padj value
}
\description{
This function visualizes normalized expression values for one or more genes from an OUTRIDER dataset
across all samples. Each gene is displayed in a separate facet with violin and boxplots to show distribution.
A specified sample is highlighted in red, with its adjusted p-value (`padj`) displayed as a label above the point.
