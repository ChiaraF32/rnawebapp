\title{Filter Annotated Results Table by Gene and/or Sample}
\usage{
filtered_annotated_table(results_tbl, genes = NULL, samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_tbl}{A data frame containing at least `geneID` and `sampleID` columns.
Typically derived from FRASER/OUTRIDER results with annotation.}

\item{genes}{Optional character vector of gene symbols to retain (matching `geneID` column).}

\item{samples}{Optional character vector of sample IDs to retain (matching `sampleID` column).}
}
\value{
A filtered `data.frame` containing only rows that match the given gene(s) and/or sample(s).
}
\description{
Filters an annotated results data frame (e.g., from OUTRIDER or FRASER)
by specified gene symbols and/or sample IDs.
}
\examples{
# Filter by gene only
filtered_annotated_table(results_tbl, genes = c("DMD", "ACTA1"))

# Filter by sample only
filtered_annotated_table(results_tbl, samples = "IVCT-38-F")

# Filter by both
filtered_annotated_table(results_tbl, genes = "MYH1", samples = "IVCT-43Y-M")
